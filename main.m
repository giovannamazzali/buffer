% Define Constants
curing_time = 600;       % Time needed for curing (10 minutes in seconds)
drawer_open_time = 8;    % Time to open or close a drawer (8 seconds)
dial_rotate_time = 6;    % Time to rotate dial (6 seconds)
num_drawers = 2;         % Number of drawers available (simplified)
positions_per_drawer = 5; % Number of positions per drawer
max_iter = 1000;         % Maximum number of iterations for policy iteration

% Define the State Space
% State consists of [buffer_status, dial_status, op_status]
% buffer_status: [empty, curing, cured] for each position in buffer
% dial_status: current status of the dial (empty, has cured tool, etc.)
% op_status: current status of OP (top, bottom)

% Action Space: Define Possible Actions
% Actions could be represented by:
% 1: Move tool from dial to OP top
% 2: Move tool from dial to OP bottom
% 3: Move tool from OP to buffer for curing
% 4: Move tool from buffer to dial
% 5: Open or close a drawer
actions = 1:5;

% State Initialization
num_states = 2 * (positions_per_drawer * num_drawers);  % Simplified state representation
V = zeros(num_states, 1);  % Value function initialization
policy = randi(length(actions), num_states, 1);  % Random initial policy

% Transition Probabilities and Rewards
% Assuming deterministic transitions for simplicity
P = zeros(num_states, num_states, length(actions));  % Transition matrix P(s'|s,a)
R = -ones(num_states, length(actions));  % Reward matrix, initially set negative for time penalties

% Initialize rewards and transitions based on problem conditions
% Update rewards for specific actions and transitions based on conditions (simplified here)

% Iteration for Policy Improvement
for iter = 1:max_iter
    % Policy Evaluation
    for state = 1:num_states
        action = policy(state);

        if ~isempty(next_state)
            V(state) = R(state, action) + V(next_state);  % Bellman update

                action_values(action) = R(state, action) + V(next_state);
            end
